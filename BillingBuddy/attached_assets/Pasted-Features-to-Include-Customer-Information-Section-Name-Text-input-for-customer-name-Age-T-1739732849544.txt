Features to Include:

Customer Information Section:

Name: Text input for customer name.
Age: Text input for age (optional).
Phone Number: Text input for contact number.
Address: Text area for full address.
Invoice Number: This should be automatically generated and incremented for each new bill. You'll need a way to store the last used number and increment it.
Date: Automatically populate with the current date, but allow the user to change it if needed.
Product/Service Details Section (Crucial Part):

Particulars: A dropdown or searchable list of items/services you offer. This makes data entry faster and more consistent. You'll need a database or file to store your product/service list.
Batch: Text input for batch number (if applicable).
Exp. (Expiry): Date input for expiry date (if applicable).
MRP (Maximum Retail Price): This should be automatically filled when the user selects a product from the "Particulars" dropdown. It should be retrieved from your product/service database.
Qty. (Quantity): Number input for quantity.
Dis% (Discount Percentage): Number input for discount percentage.
GST% (GST Percentage): This should also be automatically filled based on the selected product (from your database).
Rate: This needs to be calculated: Rate = MRP - (MRP * Dis% / 100). This should update automatically when quantity or discount changes.
Calculation Section:

Sub-Total: Calculated as SUM(Rate * Qty) for each item.
GST: Calculated as SUM((Rate * Qty) * (GST% / 100)) for each item.
Grand Total: Calculated as Sub-Total + GST.
Terms & Conditions:

A text area to display your standard terms and conditions.
Footer:

Space for signature and authorization details.
Technical Implementation (Conceptual):

Programming Language: Choose a language suitable for creating a user interface (UI) and handling calculations. Python with libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or web frameworks like Flask/Django are good options. JavaScript for web-based solutions is another strong contender.
Database: You'll need a database (even a simple file like CSV or JSON) to store:
Product/service information (name, MRP, GST%).
Customer details (if you want to save them).
Invoice history (if you want to be able to retrieve old invoices).
UI Design: Design the layout to match your example format. Use labels, text boxes, dropdowns, and tables for data entry and display.
Event Handling: Implement event handlers to:
Update the "Rate" when "Qty" or "Dis%" changes.
Populate "MRP" and "GST%" when a product is selected.
Recalculate "Sub-Total," "GST," and "Grand Total" whenever any relevant value changes.
Generate a new invoice number when a new bill is created.
Printing/Saving: Add functionality to print the invoice or save it as a PDF or other format.
